Use Ranker to create a custom "ranking poll" -a highly engaging crowdsourced list that will increase time on page by 125% and commenting 3X.


== Description ==

Use Ranker's free widget to create a fully-customizable "ranking poll" - a list about any topic that your visitors impact by voting items up and down, reranking the list, or adding items. Use it as a "POLL: _____" blog post, to add instant community engagement to an existing "list" blog post as a "reader's version", or stick Ranker lists on your sidebar to increase time on site.

The plugin comes with a built in shortcode generator, you only need the URL of the list on Ranker, we'll do the rest. Setup defaults for your site including colors, fonts, size and layout.

= How it works =
1. Find a ranking you want your visitors to vote on from the [Ranker.com](http://www.ranker.com/ "Ranker") site, or create a new one there. 
2. Copy the URL 
3. Enter that URL into Settings->Ranker Options->Shortcodes
4. Put that shortcode into any post. 

Multiple shortcodes can be used per post.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'rnkr-wp' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Set required options though admin menu.
4. Place generated short codes in your posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a short code for my posts? =
That's easy! Once the plugin is installed head to the settings page and switch to the 'shortcodes' tab. Now find the list you want to embed on [Ranker.com](http://Ranker.com/ "List the universe"), copy it's full URL (I.E. http://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/my-favorite-cartoons-of-all-time) and paste that into the input on the short codes page. We do some magic and then the usable short code for that list will be displayed below.

= Will my old V1 shortcodes work with the V2 plugin? =
Yes they will! Version 2 is fully backwards compatible, all older short codes will continue to work with the new widget.

= I've found styling errors with the widget, what should I do? =
Some themes are built to override global style definitions, sometimes these styles can cause layout issues with our widget. While we've done our best to avoid themes adjusting the widget display, on occasion one can slip through. If you find any styling errors with the widget in your theme, please leave a support ticket and we'll get them fixed as soon as possible.

= Are there any tips to building a Ranker List or Widget? =
For an in-depth FAQ on widget building please see the [Ranker Widget FAQ](http://www.ranker.com/list/the-ranker-widget-frequently-asked-questions/ranker?limit=25 "Widget FAQ")

= Wait a minute, what is Ranker, I've never heard of this service? =
Ranker has millions of items in its database - everything from universities to comic book heroes to candy brands to your favorite band's discography. To make a list, all you have to do is tell us the topic and pick the items you want to include. Ranker takes care of the rest. Once you've built your own lists, we give you the tools to share them with your friends, or to open them up for voting and let the community decide the rankings!

For a full rundown of the service please see the [Ranker FAQ](http://www.ranker.com/app/faq.htm "Full Ranker Serive FAQ").
